# README

This rudimentary blog app was built using Ruby on Rails as part of The Odin Project to understand the core structure and concepts of Rails. This involved:

- Setting up a database using SQlite3.
- Using CRUD to create and modify the articles and comments of the blog.
- Using strong parameters to prevent malicious attacks.
- Associating two models with each other, specifically having many articles, where each article can be associated with multiple comments.
- DRYing up the code using Rails' partials and concerns.
